# WnCC_SOC_PyRated
This repository contatins my contribution for the WnCC Seasons of Code '21 Project - **PyRated**, which aims to develop a source code plagiarism detector using Python. The mentors for this project were:
* [Tulip Pandey](https://github.com/tulip16)
* [Vibhav Aggarwal](https://github.com/vibhav011)

We used a multi-layered approach that is described in the flowchart below:

A brief overview of the files/folders in this repo is as follows:
* Indentation contains the code for indentation comparison in Layer 1 and sample files for comparison
* bagofwords_shiven contains the code for the bag of words approach used in Layer 0
* data_slicing contains the code for a data_slicing approach used in Layer 3 (not included in final submission)
* Final folder contains the complete program for the plagiarism detector (team contribution)

*Note: The files in this repo are the final iterations. Intermediate versions/iterations were not included as most of them were lost owing to technical difficulties.* 

The multi-layered approach was adopted from this [paper](https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume105/number12/pxc3899785.pdf).

The complete repo or the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Team-PyRated/PyRated).

The final documentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/146Hrbl5qcjx6Rr3uuqSimjE3Emh22gu69EVHmhe9cE0/edit?usp=sharing) and the video presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/vibhav011).
